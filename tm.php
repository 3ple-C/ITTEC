                                            Every year, organizations invest millions in training programs, expecting to see measurable improvements in employee performance and business outcomes. Yet, the harsh reality is that a significant portion of this investment fails to translate into real-world results. This silent, yet pervasive issue leaves leaders frustrated, resources wasted, and potential untapped.
                                            This phenomenon, aptly named Training Scrap™ by our CEO, Sandra Ihenacho, stems from years of research and practical insights into the disconnect between training initiatives and workplace application.
                                            Training Scrap™ refers to the portion of training that never gets utilized skills learned but never applied, knowledge gained but never acted upon, insights shared but left unrealized. It is the difference between what was taught in the classroom and what is actually put into practice on the job.

                                            For business, L&D, and HR leaders, Training Scrap™ is not just a financial problem—it is a performance problem. It is the reason why employees attend workshops yet fail to demonstrate measurable improvement. It is why your carefully crafted L&D strategy might look good on paper but struggles to yield the ROI and ROE you need.
                                            But it is more than just numbers. Training Scrap™ represents lost opportunities:
                                            The opportunity for your employees to reach their full potential.
                                            The opportunity to create a workforce that is engaged, equipped, and future-ready.
                                            The opportunity for your organization to stay ahead in an ever-evolving business landscape.
                                            When training fails to stick, the ripple effects are undeniable—reduced productivity, unmet goals, disengaged employees, and stagnating business growth.
